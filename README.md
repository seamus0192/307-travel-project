# Vacation Tracker (CSC307 Team Project)

## Contributing
- The coding style that we should be following is as described in the following documentation: https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/
- This react app primarily utilizes typescript, which, aside from type setting, utilizes javascript convention.

Project Blurb:
  Our project is centered around keeping track of events and plans for people all in one place.  Once you login or sign up you can start creating itineraries, naming it whatever you want and selecting a range of days along with other details.  From there you can start adding events for the different days during the itinerary, selecting a start and end time, naming, and providing a link to the website with the reservation should you need.  Once the event has been created, you can login from anywhere and check your schedule and what events you have planned.
